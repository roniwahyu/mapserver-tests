Summary
-------

   
MapServer is a system for developing web-based GIS applications. 
The basic system consists of a CGI program that can be configured to 
respond to a variety of spatial requests like making maps, scalebars, 
and point, area and feature queries. Virtually all aspects of an 
application, from web interface to map appearance can be developed 
without any programming. For the more ambitious user, MapServer 
applications can be enhanced using Java, JavaScript or many other web 
technologies. For more  information and complete documentation please 
visit:

Bug reports and enhancment submissions can be reported in the MapServer 
issue tracker at the following url.   If you do make changes and/or enhancements, 
please let us know so that they might be incorporated into future releases.

MapServer was originally written by Stephen Lime. Major funding for development of 
MapServer has been provided by NASA through cooperative argreements with 
the University of Minnesota, Department of Forest Resources.

PHP/MapScript developed by DM Solutions Group.

GDAL/OGR support and significant WMS support provided by DM Solutions Group 
which received funding support from Canadian Government's GeoConnections 
Program and the Canadian Forest Service.

Raster support developed by Pete Olson of the State of Minnesota, Land 
Management Information Center, and maintained by Frank Warmerdam (DM 
Solutions).

PostGIS spatial database support provided by Dave Blasby of Refractions 
Research.

PDF support developed by Jeff Spielberg and Jamie Wall of Market Insite Group, 
Inc.

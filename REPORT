What I found what I create thoses tests.

- Autodetect types don't works for Postgres boolean type.

- Autodetect types don't works for shapfile date and boolean types (supported on shapfile ?).

- We can't request a WMS/GetFeatureInfo on WMS client and other layer.

- We can't have a layer that mix WMS/MFS client.

- The GetFeatureInfo returns invisible features if the scale is between LAYER limits but not on CLASS limits.

- The SCALE isn't pass throw WMS client for WMS/GetLegentGraphic request #4452.
